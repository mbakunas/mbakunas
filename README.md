### Hi there 👋

I'm a cloud  architect at [Avanade](https://www.avanade.com/en-us/technologies/azure) specialzing in Azure infrastructure and infrastructure as code.


- 🏢 While the majority of my career has been in operations or infrastructure consulting, I dabble in development.
- 👷 I have over 20 years experience in enterprise operations and consulting to large/global enterprises.
- ☁️ I've been working in Azure for quite some time, and I obtained my first Azure certification in 2015.
- 🪄 I ❤ automating infrastructure deployments with IaC.
