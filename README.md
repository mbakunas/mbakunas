### Hi there 👋

I'm a cloud  architect at [Avanade](https://www.avanade.com/en-us/technologies/azure) specialzing in Azure infrastructure and infrastructure as code.


💫 While the majority of my career has been in operations or infrastructure consulting, I dabble in development.

💫 I have over 20 years experience in enterprise operations and consulting to large/global enterprises.

💫 I've been working in Azure for quite some time, and I obtained my first Azure certification in 2015.

💫 I ❤ automating infrastructure deployments with IaC.
